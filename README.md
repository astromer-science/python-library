# ASTROMER Python library üî≠
### Release: v0.0.1 (the origin üëÅÔ∏è)

ASTROMER is a transformer based model pretrained on millions of light curves. ASTROMER can be finetuned on specific datasets to create useful representations that can improve the performance of novel deep learning models.

‚ùó This version of ASTROMER can only works on single band light curves. 

üî• [See the official repo here](https://github.com/astromer-science/main-code) 

## Install
```
pip install deepweights
```

## How to use it
Currently, there are 2 pre-trained models: `macho` and `atlas`.
To load weights use:
```
from deepweights import ASTROMER

model = ASTROMER()
model.from_pretrained('macho')
```
It will automatically download the weights from [this public github repository](https://github.com/astromer-science/weights.git) and load them into the `ASTROMER()` instance.

Assuming you have a list of vary-lenght (numpy) light curves.
```
import numpy as np

samples_collection = [ np.array([[5200, 0.3, 0.2],
                                 [5300, 0.5, 0.1],
                                 [5400, 0.2, 0.3]]), 
                      
                       np.array([[4200, 0.3, 0.1],
                                 [4300, 0.6, 0.3]]) ]
                      
```
Light curves are `Lx3` matrices with time, magnitude, and magnitude std.
To encode samples use:
```
attention_vectors = model.encode(samples_collection,
                                 oids_list=['1', '2'],
                                 batch_size=1,
                                 concatenate=True)
```
where
- `samples_collection` is a list of numpy array light curves
- `oids_list` is a list with the light curves ids (needed to concatenate 200-len windows)
- `batch_size` specify the number of samples per forward pass
-  when `concatenate=True` ASTROMER concatenates every 200-lenght windows belonging the same object id (remember this version of ASTROMER only works up to 200 observations). The output when `concatenate=True` is a list of vary-length attention vectors.

## Finetuning or training from scratch
`ASTROMER` is a [Tensorflow custom model](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/custom_layers_and_models#the_model_class). It means we can use the [`fit` method](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model#fit) and [`callbacks`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks) as usual.

```
from deepweights import ASTROMER

model = ASTROMER(num_layers= 2,
                 d_model   = 256,
                 num_heads = 4,
                 dff       = 128,
                 base      = 1000,
                 dropout   = 0.1,
                 maxlen    = 200)
model.from_pretrained('macho')
```
where, 
- `num_layers`: Number of self-attention blocks
- `d_model`: Self-attention block dimension (must be divisible by `num_heads`)
- `num_heads`: Number of heads within the self-attention block 
- `dff`: Number of neurons for the fully-connected layer applied after the attention blocks
- `base`: Positional encoder base (see formula)
- `dropout`: Dropout applied to output of the fully-connected layer
- `maxlen`: Maximum length to process in the encoder
Notice you can ignore `model.from_pretrained('macho')` for clean training.
```
model.compile(optimizer='adam')
mode.fit(data, epochs=100, callbacks=[], ...)
mode.save()
```
We recomend to use the `CustomSchedule` class to control the learning rate during training.
i.e., 
```
from deepweights import CustomSchedule
learning_rate = CustomSchedule(d_model)
optimizer     = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate, 
                                         beta_1=0.9, beta_2=0.98, epsilon=1e-9)
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer)
```
For large datasets is recommended to use Tensorflow Records ([see this tutorial to execute our data pipeline](https://github.com/astromer-science/main-code/blob/main/presentation/notebooks/create_records.ipynb))
