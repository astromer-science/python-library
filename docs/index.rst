Welcome to ASTROMER documentation!
**********************************************************

**ASTROMER** is a transformer based model pretrained on millions of light curves. ASTROMER can be finetuned on specific datasets to create useful representations that can improve the performance of novel deep learning models.

‚ùó This version of ASTROMER can only works on single band light curves.
